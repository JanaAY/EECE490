The green channel plays a crucial role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection because it is less saturated compared to the blue and red channels. This allows lesions and other abnormalities to be more distinctly visible. The green channel is sensitive to the human eye, making it easier to detect regions of interest, such as exudates and other signs of DR. By enhancing the green channel using techniques like Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), we can improve the contrast and visibility of these important features, which aids in accurate DR grading and diagnosis.
