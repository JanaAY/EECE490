The green channel plays a crucial role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection because it provides better visibility of lesions and other important features in fundus images. Compared to the red and blue channels, the green channel is less saturated and is more sensitive to the human eye, making it easier to detect variations in intensity and illumination. This sensitivity helps in identifying regions of interest, such as exudates, which are important indicators of DR. By enhancing the green channel using techniques like Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), the quality of the images can be improved, leading to more accurate detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy.
