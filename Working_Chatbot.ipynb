            "Hello! The green channel plays a significant role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection because it is less saturated than the blue and red channels, making it easier to distinguish lesions and other important features in fundus images. The green channel is sensitive to the human eye, allowing for better visibility of variations in illumination and intensity. This sensitivity helps in detecting regions of interest more effectively, which is crucial for identifying signs of diabetic retinopathy. By enhancing the green channel, the detection of exudates and other abnormalities becomes clearer, improving the overall accuracy of DR screening. If you have more questions about diabetic retinopathy, feel free to ask!\n"

            "\n",
            "4. **Severe DR**: This stage is characterized by an increased number of retinal hemorrhages and a significant reduction in the number of healthy blood vessels. There is a higher risk of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n",
            "\n",
