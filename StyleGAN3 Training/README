StyleGAN3 for Synthetic Fundus Image Generation
This repository contains the code and training configurations for generating synthetic retina fundus images using StyleGAN3.

We trained two separate StyleGAN3 models:
DR model: trained on images with diabetic retinopathy (DR) signs.
NoDR model: trained on images without diabetic retinopathy (NoDR).

Datasets
The following public datasets were used for training:
- Aptos
- EyePAC
- Messidor 2
- IDRiD
- DDR
Approximately 11,000 images per class were prepared after preprocessing.

Model and Training Details
Both DR and NoDR models were trained with the following configuration:
- Model: stylegan3-t
- Batch Size: 32
- Adaptive Augmentation Target: 0.4
- Gamma: 8.2
- Generator Learning Rate: 0.002
- Discriminator Learning Rate: 0.002
- Training Length: ~760 kimg (thousands of images)

Note: The StyleGAN3 model trained on NoDR images was further fine-tuned using a different set of hyperparameters to improve generation quality.
