The green channel plays a crucial role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection because it provides better visibility of lesions and other important features compared to the red and blue channels. The green channel is less saturated, making it easier to distinguish details such as exudates and other abnormalities. Additionally, the human eye is more sensitive to green light, which helps in detecting regions of interest more effectively. By enhancing the green channel, as done with techniques like Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), the images can be processed to improve the clarity and contrast, aiding in the accurate grading of DR.
