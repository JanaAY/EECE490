Diabetic Retinopathy Research Assistant Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Research Assistant Chatbot, developed to support researchers and practitioners by answering diabetic retinopathy-specific questions based on a curated dataset of medical articles and expert knowledge.
Features:

- Domain-Specific Expertise: Focused exclusively on diabetic retinopathy (DR) topics.
- Context-Aware Responses: Answers are generated using embedded documents combined with a GPT model.
- Multi-Turn Conversations: Supports follow-up questions within the same session.
- Lightweight API Deployment: Can be easily deployed using Flask (with optional ngrok support for public access).
- Private Embedding Retrieval: Embeddings and source texts are securely handled.

Architecture:
Backend: Python, Flask
Language Model: Azure OpenAI GPT (gpt-4o-mini)
Embedding Model: text-embedding-ada-002
Data Sources: Preprocessed diabetic retinopathy research documents

How It Works:
The userâ€™s query is embedded into a vector space.
The system retrieves the most relevant document chunks using cosine similarity.
The GPT model generates a response based on both the retrieved context and its trained knowledge, restricted to DR-related topics.
