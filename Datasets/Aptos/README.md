# üìä Dataset Overview: APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection

## üîç About the Dataset

For this project, I utilized the publicly available **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset**, hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection). This dataset was released as part of a global competition organized by the **Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS)**, aiming to advance the field of automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection.

The dataset comprises **retinal fundus images** captured using a variety of imaging equipment under varying conditions. These images reflect **real-world clinical variability**, including differences in resolution, lighting, and patient eye conditions (e.g., presence of cataracts), providing a challenging but valuable resource for model development.

The objective is to classify these images into **five distinct levels of diabetic retinopathy severity**, ranging from no DR to advanced proliferative stages. Automated systems trained on this dataset are expected to assist ophthalmologists in **early detection**, **grading**, and **management** of diabetic retinopathy, ultimately reducing the risk of vision loss in diabetic patients.

## üè∑Ô∏è Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Levels & Class Distribution

The dataset categorizes each image into **five severity levels**:

| Class | Severity Description              |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| 0     | No diabetic retinopathy (No DR)   |
| 1     | Mild non-proliferative DR         |
| 2     | Moderate non-proliferative DR     |
| 3     | Severe non-proliferative DR       |
| 4     | Proliferative DR                  |

> In diabetic retinopathy, **early stages** may present with microaneurysms, while **advanced stages** (proliferative DR) involve abnormal new blood vessel growth, posing a risk of severe vision loss.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Dataset Class Distribution:**

The dataset is **imbalanced**, reflecting the natural prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the population:

| Class | Description                    | Image Count | Percentage (%) |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0     | No DR                          | 1805        | 50.19%         |
| 1     | Mild DR                        | 370         | 10.28%         |
| 2     | Moderate DR                    | 999         | 27.77%         |
| 3     | Severe DR                      | 193         | 5.36%          |
| 4     | Proliferative DR                | 295         | 8.20%          |

_Total images: 3662_

> This imbalance highlights the importance of **careful sampling strategies** and **data augmentation techniques** during model training.

## üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing Pipeline Overview

1. **Mount Google Drive:** Accessed dataset and saved processed images directly to Drive.

2. **Image Format Conversion:** Converted `.png` to `.jpeg`.

3. **Image Cleaning & Quality Filtering:**
   - Removed blurry, dark, annotated, or glare-affected images.
   - Standardized image orientation (auto-flip left eyes).
   - Enhanced contrast with **CLAHE**.
   - Resized to **512x512** pixels and normalized.

4. **Class Distribution Analysis:** Verified label consistency after cleaning.

5. **Dataset Balancing:**
   - Binary labels: `No DR` (0) and `DR` (1).
   - Balanced the dataset via undersampling.

6. **Organized Dataset Structure:**
   - Created **unbalanced** and **balanced** splits.
   - Organized images into `DR/` and `NoDR/` folders.

7. **Generated CSVs:**
   - `train_cleaned.csv`, `train_unbalanced_split.csv`, `train_balanced.csv`.
